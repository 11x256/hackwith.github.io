<p>Greetings Hacker, you are now at the right place to gain knowledge on different Open Source tools used in different stages of hacking. This blog is completely about Open Source Security Tools present in Github.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>Security is a very big domain which contains a lot of automated tools to check the security of a product(web apps/system os). But the biggest drawback of some tools is their prices. Most people use/try to download pirated versions of Security tools (whose sourcecode may sometime be recompiled with a backdoor/virus). If you google on any security tool with the extention <code class="highlighter-rouge">94fbr</code> [for finding cracked version of any software] you will be surprized to see many links showing download option. But 60% of the time, you will end up downloading an adware or a third party software instead of the required tool.</p>

<p>Instead of going through a large process of searching a pirated pentest tool, you could collect a bunch of open source tools, link them, alter the code to make some changes to fit your requirements and then use them.</p>

<p>The advantages of open source tools are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Open source tools are typically created as a <strong>collaborative effort</strong> in which programmers improve upon the code and share the changes within the community</li>
  <li>It is usually available at <strong>no charge</strong> under a license defined by the Open Source Initiative.</li>
  <li>Open source tools may be viable <strong>alternatives</strong> to popular closed-source applications</li>
  <li>Some open source tools offers <strong>features or performance benefits</strong> that surpass their commercial counterparts</li>
  <li>One can also gain <strong>knowledge in programming</strong></li>
</ul>
